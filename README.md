### 🙏 Sawasdee Krub!

I go by the name of `nerometa`, formally `Worawut Werawan`. I was a software developer trainee at [RV Connex](https://www.rvconnex.com/) for 2 years.
'Why 2 years? Why train for so long?' you might asked. It's the [Dual Vocational Training](https://www.thai-german-cooperation.info/en_US/history_education_6/) program offered by my college where you earned trade/vocational certificate and received on-the-job training. How cool is that! I found my little passion in front-end development through this.
